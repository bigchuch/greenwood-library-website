# Greenwood Library Website Project

This document outlines the setup and tasks for the Greenwood Library website project.

## Initial Repository Setup

1.  Create a Repository on GitHub:
    *   Name it **greenwood-library-website**.
    *   Initialize it with a README.md file and clone it to your local machine.

## Tasks

1.  In the `main` branch, using Visual Studio Code editor ensure there are files for each of the web pages:
    *   `home.html`
    *   `about_us.html`
    *   `events.html`
    *   `contact_us.html`
2.  Add any random content into each of the files.
3.  Stage, commit and push the changes directly to the `main` branch. (This is a simulation of the team's existing code base for the website)

2.  Switch to a new branch named `add-book-reviews`.
